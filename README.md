#MoveBox-Game-JS
This JavaScript code facilitates the movement of a box element on a web page using the arrow keys while dynamically altering its background color with each key press. It employs an event listener to detect keydown events, retrieves the box's current position, and updates its position by 20 pixels in the specified direction—up, down, left, or right—depending on the arrow key pressed. If a key other than the arrow keys is pressed, the code prompts an alert to inform the user to utilize only the arrow keys. Furthermore, each arrow key press generates a new random color for the box's background, enhancing the visual interactivity of the element.
